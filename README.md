# pandas-challenge

# I've chosen Heroes of PyMoli, though I'm also working on the school project for practice.

# this project is about continuously practicing syntax for pandas, utilizing .loc and .groupby 
# with the mathematical functions.  we have sales data, each with it's own sales ID
# so single product sales with single prices.  

# we have been asked to slice and dice the data to get summary statistics including
# summary stats, then more detailed by gender, individual customer, age, top spenders
# and item details such as more popular and profitable

# we'll need to use various combinations of .loc and .groupby to slice the data to perform 
# math functions on to get the summary stats.
