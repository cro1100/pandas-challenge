# pandas-challenge

I've chosen Heroes of PyMoli, though I'm also working on the school project for practice.

this project is about continuously practicing syntax for pandas, utilizing .loc and .groupby 
with the mathematical functions.  we have sales data, each with it's own sales ID
so single product sales with single prices.  

we have been asked to slice and dice the data to get summary statistics including
summary stats, then more detailed by gender, individual customer, age, top spenders
and item details such as more popular and profitable

we'll need to use various combinations of .loc and .groupby to slice the data to perform 
math functions on to get the summary stats.

As for observations: it's clear that this game follow unfortunate standards of mostly being
male players.  But it's interesting that women, when they play, tend to spend 10% more, $4.06 to $4.46.
If i'm the company, based off of this, I'm focusing my sales efforts on women.
This might represent the top end of what the spend scale, but there's a clear growth 
area here.  I would think strongly about a video game which appeals more broadly to women,
and make sure to have the proper add-ins which ill get higher average revenue.

Additionally, the target age demographic is 15-29, which also makes sense.  Here I would stay
within the target range rahter than trying to go outside this demographic.  Simply put, 
people of this age have more time to play games and more willingness to devote time.
I would recommend the company not move off of this sweet spot.
